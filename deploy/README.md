# 🚀 Production Deployment

This directory defines the production deployment workflow for the 167 Guild Wiki.

The process is environment-driven and uses Docker Compose as the source of truth.

The initial public production target is the apex domain `167guild.io`.

```

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu LTS server (single VM target)
- Docker Engine + Docker Compose plugin installed
- Repository cloned on server
- `task` installed (recommended)
- A configured `.env.production` file (never commit)

## Server Requirements

- Inbound ports `80` and `443` open to the server
- Sufficient persistent storage for:
  - PostgreSQL data
  - Wiki.js uploads/assets
  - Caddy state/config
- Outbound internet access for container pulls and TLS provisioning

## Domain Ownership and Deployment Assumptions

- The production deployment assumes the 167 Guild team controls the registrar and DNS zone for `167guild.io`.
- The initial hosting target is one Ubuntu LTS virtual machine with a public IPv4 address. IPv6 is optional but recommended if available.
- Caddy is the only public-facing service and should be the only service bound to ports `80` and `443`.
- PostgreSQL must remain private on the internal Docker network.
- Use placeholders for values that are not yet known, such as the ACME notification email address, server IP addresses, and Google OAuth client credentials.

## Expected DNS Records

Create DNS records that direct the public domain to the production server before running the first HTTPS deployment.

| Type | Name | Value | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `A` | `@` | `YOUR_SERVER_IPV4` | Yes | Primary apex record for `167guild.io`. |
| `AAAA` | `@` | `YOUR_SERVER_IPV6` | Optional | Add only if the server is reachable over IPv6. |
| `CNAME` | `www` | `167guild.io` | Optional | Convenience DNS alias if `www` will be supported later. |
| `CNAME` | `wiki` | `167guild.io` | Optional | Future-friendly DNS alias if the wiki is moved to a subdomain later. |

If your DNS provider does not allow `CNAME` records at the apex, keep the apex on `A`/`AAAA` records and use aliases only for subdomains.

## Environment Setup

1. Copy the production template:

   ```bash
   cp deploy/examples/.env.production.example .env.production
   ```

2. Replace placeholders with real production values.

### Environment Management Philosophy

- Keep local development in `.env` copied from `.env.example`.
- Keep production configuration in `.env.production` copied from `deploy/examples/.env.production.example`.
- Commit templates only; never commit populated environment files.
- Treat the environment files as the source of truth for domain, database, and OAuth configuration so production stays fully environment-driven.

### Wiki.js Configuration Strategy (v0.1.0)

Production uses a hybrid strategy:

- **Environment variables** provide runtime settings and OAuth secrets (`.env.production`).
- **Wiki.js Admin UI** is the source of truth for enabling Google auth strategy, first administrator bootstrap, and RBAC assignments.

This is intentional because Wiki.js persists provider enablement, group memberships, and page rules in PostgreSQL after first boot.

### Required Variables

- `DOMAIN`
- `EMAIL`
- `WIKI_BASE_URL`
- `WIKI_UPSTREAM`
- `POSTGRES_DB`
- `POSTGRES_USER`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `DB_HOST`
- `DB_PORT`
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`

### Production Domain Values

The production template is already wired for the primary public domain:

- `DOMAIN=167guild.io`
- `WIKI_BASE_URL=https://167guild.io`
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL=https://167guild.io/login/callback`

Replace only the remaining placeholders (email address, database password, and OAuth credentials) before deployment.

### Caddy and Reverse Proxy Configuration

- `config/caddy/Caddyfile` stays generic and reads `DOMAIN`, `EMAIL`, and `WIKI_UPSTREAM` from the environment.
- In production, Caddy should terminate TLS for `167guild.io`, redirect HTTP to HTTPS automatically, and proxy traffic to `wikijs:3000`.
- `WIKI_UPSTREAM` should remain on the internal Docker network so Wiki.js is not exposed directly to the internet.
- If the public domain ever changes, update `.env.production`, DNS, and Google OAuth callback settings together.

### Google OAuth Callback URLs

Configure the Google OAuth client as a **Web application** and authorize the exact production callback URL:

- Authorized JavaScript origin: `https://167guild.io`
- `https://167guild.io/login/callback`

If additional domains or subdomains are introduced later, add each exact callback URL explicitly in Google Cloud Console.

`deploy/scripts/validate-env.sh` fails fast with actionable errors if required values are missing or still placeholders.

## First Boot and Administrator Bootstrap

After the first successful `task deploy:production`:

1. Open `https://167guild.io` and complete the Wiki.js setup wizard.
2. Create an emergency admin account for break-glass access.
3. In Wiki.js Admin, configure and enable Google auth using:
   - `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`
4. Sign in with `szmyty@gmail.com` through Google.
5. Assign `szmyty@gmail.com` to the built-in **Administrators** group.
6. Verify `szmyty@gmail.com` can access **Administration**.

Platform Administrator responsibilities:

- Own authentication configuration.
- Own user/group assignments and RBAC reviews.
- Own operational maintenance and recovery tasks.

## Group Bootstrap and Onboarding

Seed custom groups after first boot initializes Wiki.js schema:

```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres psql \
  -U "${POSTGRES_USER}" \
  -d "${POSTGRES_DB}" \
  < scripts/bootstrap/seed-groups.sql
```

Initial role assignment targets:

- **Platform Administrator**: `szmyty@gmail.com`
- **Dungeon Master**: placeholder DM account listed in `docs/authorization.md#placeholder-accounts` (replace with final DM email)
- **Players**: Alan (Starwhisper), Kevin, Christian, and Tom using accounts listed in `docs/authorization.md#placeholder-accounts`

Dungeon Master responsibilities:

- Manage hidden `/dm/` planning content.
- Maintain lore and campaign materials.
- Review and curate player-submitted content.

## HTTPS and SSL Lifecycle

- Caddy provisions and renews certificates automatically after `167guild.io` resolves to the production server and ports `80` and `443` are reachable.
- The ACME account email is supplied through `EMAIL`; replace the example placeholder with a real monitored mailbox before the first production deployment.
- Certificates and ACME state are stored in the `caddy_data` volume, while runtime config is cached in `caddy_config`.
- On first deploy, expect certificate issuance to happen during Caddy startup; repeated restarts should reuse stored state unless volumes are removed.

## DNS Propagation Considerations

- DNS changes may take time to propagate based on provider TTLs and resolver caches.
- Do not treat an immediate TLS failure as an application failure until you confirm `167guild.io` resolves to the correct server from the deployment host and from an external resolver.
- If DNS has not propagated yet, `deploy/scripts/health-check.sh` may skip the public HTTPS check for the domain.
- Lower DNS TTL values ahead of cutover when possible to reduce propagation delay during the first production switch.

## Deployment Lifecycle

From the repository root:

```bash
task deploy:production
```

`task deploy` is kept as a stable top-level entrypoint and currently delegates to `deploy:production`.

This performs:

1. Environment validation
2. Compose validation
3. Build/recreate containers with production overrides
4. Post-deploy runtime health checks (`task health`)

Useful operations:

```bash
task status
task logs
task restart
task stop
task health
```

## Upgrade Procedure

1. Pull latest source.
2. Review release notes and `.env.production` changes.
3. Run deployment:

   ```bash
   task deploy:production
   ```

4. Run health checks:

   ```bash
   task health
   ```

## Rollback Strategy

If deployment fails:

1. Revert to previous known-good commit.
2. Redeploy previous commit with the same `.env.production`.
3. Restore data if needed with existing restore workflow:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/restore/restore.sh ./backups/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS .env.production
   ```

Persistent volumes are externalized in Docker volumes, so container rollback does not discard data.

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

- Backup command: `bash scripts/backup/backup.sh .env.production`
- Restore command: `bash scripts/restore/restore.sh ./backups/<timestamp> .env.production`
- Restore order: configuration → Wiki.js data volume → PostgreSQL
- Backup manifest checksums are verified automatically during restore

Recommended production cadence:

- Daily scheduled backup
- Pre-deploy backup
- Additional backup before risky maintenance

For full disaster recovery flow, see `docs/backup.md`.

## Production Logging and Rotation

Production services use Docker `json-file` logging with rotation:

- `max-size=10m`
- `max-file=5`

Configured in `deploy/production/docker-compose.production.yml` for:

- `caddy`
- `wikijs`
- `postgres`

View logs with:

```bash
task logs
```

## Container Version Pinning Strategy

Production uses fixed image tags in `deploy/production/docker-compose.production.yml`:

- `caddy:2.10.2-alpine`
- `ghcr.io/requarks/wiki:2.5.306`
- `postgres:16.9-alpine`

Version updates should be explicit and reviewed in pull requests to keep deployments reproducible.

## Security Hardening Checklist

- [ ] Exposed ports reviewed: only Caddy publishes host ports (`80`, `443`)
- [ ] Docker networking reviewed: Wiki.js and PostgreSQL are private on the internal network
- [ ] Restart policies reviewed: all production services use `unless-stopped`
- [ ] Health checks reviewed for Caddy, Wiki.js, and PostgreSQL
- [ ] Environment handling reviewed: `.env.production` is required and validated before deploy

- [ ] First content pages are created and validated for expected role visibility
- [ ] Backup/restore workflow is validated against the current runbook scope and documented
- [ ] Wiki.js role permissions are validated for Administrators, Dungeon Master, Player, and Viewer

## Health Verification Details

- **Caddy**: `curl -I https://$DOMAIN` should return a valid HTTP response.
- **Wiki.js**: `task health` checks `http://localhost:3000/healthz` inside the container and falls back to `/` if needed.
- The primary `/healthz` endpoint matches this repository's Docker Compose healthcheck.
- **PostgreSQL**: `task health` runs `pg_isready`.
- **Authentication**: perform a test Google OAuth login in the deployed wiki.
- **Groups/RBAC**: verify `Administrators`, `Dungeon Master`, `Player`, and `Viewer` exist and contain expected users.
- **Namespaces**:
  - `Administrators`: full access everywhere.
  - `Dungeon Master`: read/write including `/dm/`.
  - `Player`: no access to `/dm/`; write access under `/characters/` and `/journals/`.
  - `Viewer`: read-only access to non-DM namespaces.
- **First content creation**: publish at least one page in `/lore/`, `/characters/`, `/journals/`, and `/dm/` and verify visibility by role.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Google button missing: strategy not enabled in Wiki.js Admin.
  - OAuth callback error: Google redirect URI does not exactly match `.env.production`.
  - Access denied after login: user not assigned to the expected group.
- **Backups**: verify backup artifact and restore validation by running a restore drill in non-production.

### Manual Steps Captured for Future Automation

- Wiki.js initial setup wizard completion and emergency admin bootstrap
- First-login group assignment/verification in Wiki.js Admin
- Google OAuth provider enablement/validation in Wiki.js Admin
- Post-deploy role-based namespace verification (`/dm/`, `/characters/`, `/journals/`, `/lore/`)
- Final release sign-off checklist and GitHub Release confirmation

## Remaining Assumptions and Risks

- Initial production release assumes a single Ubuntu LTS VM and Docker Compose runtime; high-availability failover is out of scope for this cut.
- Role assignment still requires manual verification in Wiki.js Admin after first OAuth sign-in for each user.

## GitHub Actions Scaffold

See `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` for an optional manual deployment scaffold.
It intentionally uses placeholders and does **not** configure production secrets.
